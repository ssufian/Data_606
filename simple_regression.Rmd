## Batter up 

The movie [Moneyball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)) focuses on
the "quest for the secret of success in baseball". It follows a low-budget team, 
the Oakland Athletics, who believed that underused statistics, such as a player's 
ability to get on base, betterpredict the ability to score runs than typical 
statistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining 
players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more 
affordable for the team.

In this lab we'll be looking at data from all 30 Major League Baseball teams and
examining the linear relationship between runs scored in a season and a number 
of other player statistics. Our aim will be to summarize these relationships 
both graphically and numerically in order to find which variable, if any, helps 
us best predict a team's runs scored in a season.

## The data

Let's load up the data for the 2011 season.

```{r load-data, eval=TRUE}

download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/mlb11.RData", destfile = "mlb11.RData")
load("mlb11.RData")

head(mlb11,n=7)
```

In addition to runs scored, there are seven traditionally used variables in the 
data set: at-bats, hits, home runs, batting average, strikeouts, stolen bases, 
and wins. There are also three newer variables: on-base percentage, slugging 
percentage, and on-base plus slugging. For the first portion of the analysis 
we'll consider the seven traditional variables. At the end of the lab, you'll 
work with the newer variables on your own.

1.  What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between `runs` 
    and one of the other numerical variables? Plot this relationship using the 
    variable `at_bats` as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? If 
    you knew a team's `at_bats`, would you be comfortable using a linear model 
    to predict the number of runs?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Same, but with different colors and add regression lines
ggplot(mlb11, aes(x=mlb11$at_bats, y=mlb11$runs)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +
    scale_colour_hue(l=50) + # Use a slightly darker palette than normal
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression lines
                se=FALSE)    # Don't add shaded confidence region

```
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage  
    
ans:

a) I use scatter plot 'runs' as the response variables using the other variables as predictor variables

or (indpendent variables) for instance, the 'at_bats'.


b) Yes, there is a linear relationship between at_bats vs. runs

c) This is a toughie as the saying goes "Looks can be deceiving"; looking at the dignostics:

- The Q-Q plot looks suspect with some wrinkles in the middle

- But the residuals vs independent variables and histogram of residuals do not look too bad

- However, the last test of Shapior-Wilk test of the parents (NOT the Residuals) showed that the parents

are normal.

Therefore I would be OK with using it as linear model predictive tool despite some mis-givings in the 

residual tests


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.height=4}

mlb.lm = lm(runs ~ at_bats, data=mlb11) 
mlb.res = resid(mlb.lm) 

 plot(mlb11$at_bats, mlb.res, 
     ylab="Residuals", xlab="at_bats", 
     main="residuals plot of at_bats vs. runs") 
 abline(0, 0) # the horizon 
 
```
```{r}
mlb.lm = lm(runs ~ at_bats, data=mlb11) 
mlb.stdres = rstandard(mlb.lm)

qqnorm(mlb.stdres, 
     ylab="Standardized Residuals", 
     xlab="Normal Scores", 
     main="Q-Q Plot of residuals") 
 qqline(mlb.stdres) 


```
```{r}

library(MASS)

fit <- lm(runs ~ at_bats, data=mlb11) 
sresid <- studres(fit) 
hist(sresid, freq=FALSE, 
   main="Distribution of Studentized Residuals")
xfit<-seq(min(sresid),max(sresid),length=40) 
yfit<-dnorm(xfit) 
lines(xfit, yfit) 

```
```{r}
#shapiro test 1
shapiro.test(mlb11$runs) #Shapiro test for normality; making sure the parrents are really normal
#shapiro test 2
shapiro.test(mlb11$at_bats)
```


## Shapiro Wilk test to make sure Wind is really Normal

Because P-values are greater than 0.05, we can be 95% confident that run & at_bats data is normal for

sure (this is only checking parents and not the residuals)

My assumption is if the parents are normal, the residuals should behave somewhat like the parents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

If the relationship looks linear, we can quantify the strength of the
relationship with the correlation coefficient.

```{r cor, eval=TRUE}
cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$at_bats)
```

## Sum of squared residuals

Think back to the way that we described the distribution of a single variable. 
Recall that we discussed characteristics such as center, spread, and shape. It's
also useful to be able to describe the relationship of two numerical variables, 
such as `runs` and `at_bats` above.

2.  Looking at your plot from the previous exercise, describe the relationship 
    between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and 
    strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations.

    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

The relationship between the variables at_bats and runs appears to be positive and linear. The strength

of the relationship is weak to moderate. There are few outliers with at_bats above 5500 and runs above

850. Other than that there are no unusual observations.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

Just as we used the mean and standard deviation to summarize a single variable, 
we can summarize the relationship between these two variables by finding the 
line that best follows their association. Use the following interactive 
function to select the line that you think does the best job of going through 
the cloud of points.

```{r plotss-atbats-runs, eval=TRUE}
plot_ss(x = mlb11$at_bats, y = mlb11$runs)
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted to click two points on the plot 
to define a line. Once you've done that, the line you specified will be shown in
black and the residuals in blue. Note that there are 30 residuals, one for each 
of the 30 observations. Recall that the residuals are the difference between the
observed values and the values predicted by the line:

\[
  e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\]

The most common way to do linear regression is to select the line that minimizes
the sum of squared residuals. To visualize the squared residuals, you can rerun 
the plot command and add the argument `showSquares = TRUE`.

```{r plotss-atbats-runs-squares, eval=TRUE}
plot_ss(x = mlb11$at_bats, y = mlb11$runs, showSquares = TRUE)
```

Note that the output from the `plot_ss` function provides you with the slope and
intercept of your line as well as the sum of squares.

3.  Using `plot_ss`, choose a line that does a good job of minimizing the sum of
    squares. Run the function several times. What was the smallest sum of 
    squares that you got? How does it compare to your neighbors?

## The linear model

It is rather cumbersome to try to get the correct least squares line, i.e. the 
line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, through trial and error. 
Instead we can use the `lm` function in R to fit the linear model (a.k.a. 
regression line).

```{r m1, eval=TRUE}
m1 <- lm(runs ~ at_bats, data = mlb11)
```

The first argument in the function `lm` is a formula that takes the form 
`y ~ x`. Here it can be read that we want to make a linear model of `runs` as a 
function of `at_bats`. The second argument specifies that R should look in the 
`mlb11` data frame to find the `runs` and `at_bats` variables.

The output of `lm` is an object that contains all of the information we need 
about the linear model that was just fit. We can access this information using 
the summary function.

```{r summary-m1, eval=TRUE}
summary(m1)
```

Let's consider this output piece by piece. First, the formula used to describe 
the model is shown at the top. After the formula you find the five-number 
summary of the residuals. The "Coefficients" table shown next is key; its first 
column displays the linear model's y-intercept and the coefficient of `at_bats`.
With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the 
linear model:

\[
  \hat{y} = -2789.2429 + 0.6305 * atbats
\]

One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the 
Multiple R-squared, or more simply, $R^2$. The $R^2$ value represents the 
proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the 
explanatory variable. For this model, 37.3% of the variability in runs is 
explained by at-bats.

4.  Fit a new model that uses `homeruns` to predict `runs`. Using the estimates 
    from the R output, write the equation of the regression line. What does the 
    slope tell us in the context of the relationship between success of a team 
    and its home runs?
```{r}
m2 <- lm(runs ~ homeruns, data = mlb11)
summary(m2)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage


Linear equation: runs=415.2388849+1.8345416∗homeruns


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage



## Prediction and prediction errors

Let's create a scatterplot with the least squares line laid on top.

```{r reg-with-line, eval=TRUE}
plot(mlb11$runs ~ mlb11$at_bats)
abline(m1)
```

The function `abline` plots a line based on its slope and intercept. Here, we 
used a shortcut by providing the model `m1`, which contains both parameter 
estimates. This line can be used to predict $y$ at any value of $x$. When 
predictions are made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed
data, it is referred to as *extrapolation* and is not usually recommended. 
However, predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. 
They're also used to compute the residuals.

5.  If a team manager saw the least squares regression line and not the actual 
    data, how many runs would he or she predict for a team with 5,578 at-bats? 
    Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and by how much? In other 
    words, what is the residual for this prediction?
    
```{r}
atbats <- 5578
yPredicted <- -2789.2429 + 0.6305 * atbats
yPredicted
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
#Find the actuals

actual_df <- mlb11 %>% 
  filter(at_bats == 5579)
yactual <- actual_df$runs

yactual

residual <- yactual - yPredicted

residual
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

The model predicted higher than the actual; therefore, it was an over-estimation by 14.68


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage


## Model diagnostics

To assess whether the linear model is reliable, we need to check for (1) 
linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability.

*Linearity*: You already checked if the relationship between runs and at-bats
is linear using a scatterplot. We should also verify this condition with a plot 
of the residuals vs. at-bats. Recall that any code following a *#* is intended
to be a comment that helps understand the code but is ignored by R.

```{r residuals, eval=TRUE}
plot(m1$residuals ~ mlb11$at_bats)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)  # adds a horizontal dashed line at y = 0
```

6.  Is there any apparent pattern in the residuals plot? What does this indicate
    about the linearity of the relationship between runs and at-bats?
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

Like I said, the the previous question, "Looks can be deceiving".  There appears to be more points to

the left but then the number of points above and below zero seems random, which indicate a nearly normal

residual set but not a "slam dunk" normal behavior

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage
    
*Nearly normal residuals*: To check this condition, we can look at a histogram

```{r hist-res, eval=TRUE}
hist(m1$residuals)
```

or a normal probability plot of the residuals.

```{r qq-res, eval=TRUE}
qqnorm(m1$residuals)
qqline(m1$residuals)  # adds diagonal line to the normal prob plot
```

7.  Based on the histogram and the normal probability plot, does the nearly 
    normal residuals condition appear to be met?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

- It seems reasonable to assume only the nearly normal residuals condition is met though there are some

deviations in the line in the middle as mention before

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

*Constant variability*:

8.  Based on the plot in (1), does the constant variability condition appear to 
    be met?
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage    
    
ans:

Condition for constant variability says that the variability of points around the least squares line

remains roughly constant. It appears that the constant variability condition is met here.

## On Your Own

-   Choose another traditional variable from `mlb11` that you think might be a 
    good predictor of `runs`. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit 
    a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?
    
```{r}
# Same, but with different colors and add regression lines
ggplot(mlb11, aes(x=mlb11$bat_avg, y=mlb11$runs)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +
    scale_colour_hue(l=50) + # Use a slightly darker palette than normal
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression lines
                se=FALSE)    # Don't add shaded confidence region
```
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

Using Batting avg. as predictor variables

And Yes, at first glance, it appears to be very linear and have a positive correlational relationship

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage
    

-   How does this relationship compare to the relationship between `runs` and 
    `at_bats`? Use the R$^2$ values from the two model summaries to compare. 
    Does your variable seem to predict `runs` better than `at_bats`? How can you
    tell?
    
```{r}
# runs vs. at_bats
at_bats_rho <- cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$at_bats)

# runs vs. batting avg
batting_avg_rho <- cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$bat_avg)

R_square_at_batts <- at_bats_rho*at_bats_rho 
R_square_batting_avg <- batting_avg_rho*batting_avg_rho
R_square_at_batts
R_square_batting_avg

```
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

Using R square, batting avg is a better fit as it explains more of the deviations of the runs

as compared to the at_bats variables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage
    
    
-   Now that you can summarize the linear relationship between two variables, 
    investigate the relationships between `runs` and each of the other five 
    traditional variables. Which variable best predicts `runs`? Support your 
    conclusion using the graphical and numerical methods we've discussed (for 
    the sake of conciseness, only include output for the best variable, not all 
    five).
```{r}
m1 = lm(runs ~ at_bats,      data = mlb11)
m3 = lm(runs ~ stolen_bases, data = mlb11)

rSquaredAtBats  = summary(m1)$r.squared
rSquaredStBases = summary(m3)$r.squared

rSquaredAtBats

rSquaredStBases
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

All answers are for the R squares:

-value for variable at_bats is 0.3728654 


-value for variable stolen_bases is 0.002914


- value of at_bats is significantly higher than R


 value of stolen_bases, we can say that at_bats is a better predictor than stolen_bases.
 
## The best predictor is batting avg.

The highest R square is 0.65, see R code above
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage 

-   Now examine the three newer variables. These are the statistics used by the 
    author of *Moneyball* to predict a teams success. In general, are they more 
    or less effective at predicting runs that the old variables? Explain using 
    appropriate graphical and numerical evidence. Of all ten variables we've 
    analyzed, which seems to be the best predictor of `runs`? Using the limited 
    (or not so limited) information you know about these baseball statistics, 
    does your result make sense?
    
    
```{r}
m1  = lm(runs ~ at_bats,        data = mlb11)
m2  = lm(runs ~ hits,           data = mlb11)
m3  = lm(runs ~ homeruns,       data = mlb11)
m4  = lm(runs ~ bat_avg,        data = mlb11)
m5  = lm(runs ~ strikeouts,     data = mlb11)
m6  = lm(runs ~ stolen_bases,   data = mlb11)
m7  = lm(runs ~ wins,           data = mlb11)
m8  = lm(runs ~ new_onbase,     data = mlb11)
m9  = lm(runs ~ new_slug,       data = mlb11)
m10 = lm(runs ~ new_obs,        data = mlb11) # this one has the highest R square score

rSquared1  = summary(m1)$r.squared
rSquared2  = summary(m2)$r.squared
rSquared3  = summary(m3)$r.squared
rSquared4  = summary(m4)$r.squared
rSquared5  = summary(m5)$r.squared
rSquared6  = summary(m6)$r.squared
rSquared7  = summary(m7)$r.squared
rSquared8  = summary(m8)$r.squared
rSquared9  = summary(m9)$r.squared
rSquared10 = summary(m10)$r.squared

xR = c(rSquared1, rSquared2, rSquared3, rSquared4, rSquared5, rSquared6, rSquared7, rSquared8, rSquared9, rSquared10)
xR
```
    
```{r}
max(xR)
```
    
 ans:
 
Of all the ten variables, the three new variables have highest R values to predict a team’s success.

And within these 3 new variables, the obs variable has the highest R square score
    

-   Check the model diagnostics for the regression model with the variable you 
    decided was the best predictor for runs.

```{r}
m10 = lm(runs ~ new_obs,        data = mlb11)
plot(m10$residuals ~ mlb11$new_obs)
abline(h = 0, lty = 3)  # adds a horizontal dashed line at y = 0
```


```{r}
hist(m10$residuals)
```


```{r}
qqnorm(m10$residuals)
qqline(m10$residuals)  # adds diagonal line to the normal prob plot
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\clearpage

ans:

The diagnostics checks out;  The residuals seems scatter, histogram appears quite normal and the Q-Q 

plots looks good with no kinks are extreme deviations
